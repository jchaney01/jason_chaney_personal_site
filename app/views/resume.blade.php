        <p>I was the primary developer on this responsive AngularJS/HTML5 Canvas and Node application.  Users can customize all aspects of a knife including uploading their own art, custom text and blade shapes.  Customizations animate on screen using HTML5 Canvas, handles are programmatically colorized and final renders are generated with Node and sent to the engraver machines.</p>

        <h2 id="oregontreasures"><a href="http://oregonstreasures.com/" target="_blank">Oregon Lottery - oregonstreasures.com</a></h2>

        <p>I created this AngularJS scratcher game for the Oregon Lottery. The app presents a series of timed games

        <p>I was contracted directly by DIRECTV corporate to build the website for DIRECTV's School's
            program.
            The site provided registration, information and support to enrolled schools as well as resources to help
            them raise funds. The site made heavy use of Javascript animation and was created in CodeIgniter. The
            site
            interfaced directly with DIRECTV's systems and provides existing customer tools to help track funds
            raised and manage their DIRECTV subscription. A custom CMS was also built to allow administration of the
            program.  The site has since been closed and replaced with a more static version. </p>

                technology. When faced with difficult questions on the project we teamed up on, he was quick to
                offer
                numerous technical solutions to answer those questions. He was a project manager's dream since

                instilled confidence in the fact that he would get his projects completed in a thoughtful and timely
                manner.
